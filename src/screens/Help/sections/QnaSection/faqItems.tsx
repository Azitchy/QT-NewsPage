        answer: (
          <>
            Well, sorry to disappoint the more sceptical among you but no, it's not! The ATM algorithm, cleverly named ATMRank, 
            is based on Google's PageRank. The resemblance is not just in name but also in code - you can see for yourself, 
            it's open source. Would you say that Google's PageRank is a pyramid scheme? üôÇ
            <br/>
            ATM's rewards are entirely dependent on your influence as an influencer (sorry, don't have a thesaurus handy...) - 
            While the early adopters have been rewarded significantly, it does not mean that they are benefitting from your arrival to the network as would be the case in a classic pyramid scheme.
            <br/>
            The reward mechanism is a zero-sum game, meaning that that you can only grow your share of the pie but the pie itself never grows - 
            hardly a good deal for those pesky users at the top of the pyramid, right!? And don't forget, you don't even need an invite to join ATM - that's the opposite of a pyramid scheme!

        question: "What‚Äôs that ‚ÄòDeflationary Mechanism‚Äô you mentioned?",
        answer: "After 1000 days from the initial LUCA event, the deflationary mechanism will be initialised. This process will check the percentage that LUCA drops compared with the average price of the previous day and then automatically lower the LUCA issuance by the same percentage. Note that LUCA locked in Consensus Contracts will not be affected by the deflation!"

If the proposal obtains more than 2/3 YES, it is approved and implementation starts. Otherwise, the proposal is failed and will not be implemented. (2) For special proposals, the proposal initiator shall publicize the entry-into-force conditions and implementation of the proposal in the community in advance.
