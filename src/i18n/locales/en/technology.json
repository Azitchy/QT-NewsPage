The reason why it is called \"PageRank\" is that such algorithm is used to rank webpages and was first proposed by Larry Page, the Google co-founder. Equivalently, we use the consensus connection between users to replace the link between web pages in the original PageRank algorithm, and calculate the PR value of each user node in the ATM network to represent the user's influence in the community."
