            "answerPara3": "The reward mechanism is a zero-sum game, meaning that that you can only grow your share of the pie but the pie itself never grows - hardly a good deal for those pesky users at the top of the pyramid, right!? And don't forget, you don't even need an invite to join ATM - that's the opposite of a pyramid scheme!"
